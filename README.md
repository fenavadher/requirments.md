# SahaayAI – Requirements Document

## 1. The Problem

A large section of India’s population is unable to access government schemes, public services, and opportunities—not because these services do not exist, but because people are unaware of them.

Most digital solutions assume that users will:
- Actively search for information  
- Install apps  
- Type queries  
- Understand English or technical interfaces  

In reality:
- People do not know which schemes exist  
- People do not know they are eligible  
- People do not know they are missing benefits  
- People rarely search or ask for help  

As a result, even well-designed apps and chatbots fail to reach the people who need help the most.

- Local administrators and social workers

## 3. The Solution Overview

SahaayAI is a proactive, AI-powered community outreach system designed for Bharat.

Unlike traditional solutions that wait for users to come to an app, SamvaadAI identifies who may need help and reaches them directly using voice-based communication in local languages.

The system guides users step-by-step, ensuring awareness, eligibility understanding, and successful access to benefits without requiring app installation or typing.

## 4. The AI Edge

AI is a core enabler, not an add-on.

- Detect access gaps based on demographic and regional patterns  
- Prioritize outreach efforts intelligently  
- Personalize voice interactions in local languages  
- Continuously improve recommendations based on outcomes  

This is proactive, action-oriented AI—not a reactive chatbot.
